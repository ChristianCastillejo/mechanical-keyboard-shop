# Mechanical Keyboard Shop

## Assignment

1. Connect to Shopify's Storefront API with the domain https://mechanical-keyboard-shop.myshopify.com/api/2020-01/graphql.json (access key will be sent in the email)
You can find the official documentation here: https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api and a "Getting started" guide here: https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api/getting-started
2. Create `pages/products.tsx` to display an overview of the products in the `keyboard` collection. There is a collection already with the handle `keyboard`.
3. Create `pages/[handle].tsx` that will display an individual product and variants 

## Note

This is a Typescript project and everything you write should be valid Typescript. You can add additional packages and it's encouraged to use Apollo for anything GraphQL related.
